# 🎮 Game Glitch Investigator: The Impossible Guesser

## 🚨 The Situation

You asked an AI to build a simple "Number Guessing Game" using Streamlit.
It wrote the code, ran away, and now the game is unplayable. 

- You can't win.
- The hints lie to you.
- The secret number seems to have commitment issues.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the broken app: `python -m streamlit run app.py`

## 🕵️‍♂️ Your Mission

1. **Play the game.** Open the "Developer Debug Info" tab in the app to see the secret number. Try to win.
2. **Find the State Bug.** Why does the secret number change every time you click "Submit"? Ask ChatGPT: *"How do I keep a variable from resetting in Streamlit when I click a button?"*
3. **Fix the Logic.** The hints ("Higher/Lower") are wrong. Fix them.
4. **Refactor & Test.** - Move the logic into `logic_utils.py`.
   - Run `pytest` in your terminal.
   - Keep fixing until all tests pass!

## 📝 Document Your Experience

- [The game is designed to select a rando number and let the uset guess which number is it. It also provides hints to go lower or higher. ] 
- [The hints were swapped | Starting a new game after the first one was over was not possible | Changing the difficulty level was not consistent]
- [I swapped the hints messages so it can display the correct hint | Changed the state from Won or Lost to playing so it can allow the user to play again | Adjust the range for the difficulty level being selected and made the dashbaord use the "high" and "low" values so it displays the correct range always] 

## 📸 Demo Walkthrough

Describe your fixed game in numbered steps so a reader can follow along without watching a video:

## Demo Walkthrough
1. User enters a guess of 40
2. Game returns "Too Low"
3. User enters a guess of 70, and the game shows "Too High"
4. Score updates correctly after each guess
5. Game ends after the correct guess

6. User press New Game BUTTON
7. The input field is reset. A new secret number is randomized. 
8. User can start guessing again

9. User can adjust difficulty level from dropdown
